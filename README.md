# Personal nvim setup -- Aimed at Go and Angular

## Try out this config

Make sure to remove or move your current `nvim` directory

This runs for me on nvim 0.8

```
git clone https://https://github.com/arnevm123/vimsetup.git ~/.config/nvim
```

This config is based around Lazy.nvim plugins are lazy loaded by it and configurations can be easily accessed
by looking in the LazyPlugins.lua file
